## Requirements

### Technologies to be used:

### Constraints and Conventions:

- Use of vector file formats for images
- Use of only functional components
- Applying atomic design principles
- Developing the project with frequent commits on version control system
- Use of "conventional commits" convention for commit messages
- Minimum 60% unit testing code coverage
- Writing a markdown documentation to describe how to run it


## How to Get Started?

Begin by creating a full-stack project base.

Next, transfer the codebase to a git repository and share the repository address upon completion.


## Product Expectations

We want an interface that lists photos and their comments by albums. Feel free to read the directions from [jsonplaceholder.typicode.com](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/).

- Users should be able to list the albums.
- Users should be able to search for photos using a search input.
- Upon clicking a photo, users should see its details, including the album name and comments.
- Paginate results if the search yields more than 25 items.
- The project should be accessible, responsive and usable on mobile.


## Engineering Expectations

- Measure FCP, LCP, TBT, TTI and CLS scores.
- Use Web APIs as much as possible.
- Including snapshot testing and/or E2E tests are a huge plus.
- It's not mandatory but using a design system and a story book of used components would be nice.
